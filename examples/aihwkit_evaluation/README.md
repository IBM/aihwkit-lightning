# AIHWKIT Evaluation
In this example, a model is converted to an analog-equivalent represenation using the aihwkit-lightning. Then, it is exported to an aihwkit representation which supports evaluation using a statistical inference model. Programming noise is applied using drift_analog_weights().

Note: To run this example, both aihwkit and aihwkit-lightning must be installed.
